I am Maria Eduarda, I am 20 years old and I am currently a graduate student in the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
at FAM - Centro Universitário, where I have been improving my technical and theoretical skills in the area of ​​technology.<br>
Currently, I lead the college's semester project group, where we coordinate the creation of technological solutions, applying the knowledge acquired in 
the classroom. As a leader, I have had the opportunity to apply my practical knowledge and develop leadership skills. I believe that the continuous search 
for knowledge is fundamental to success in the area of ​​technology. Therefore, I am always looking for new learning opportunities, such as online courses, workshops 
and immersions to contribute significantly to the job market.<br>
I am proficient in English at a basic-intermediate level, which helps me to create and collaborate on projects and keep up to date with the latest technology trends.
